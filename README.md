I wrote this small program originally in 2010, and after that there have been changes in hs.fi RSS-feeds.
As a consequence, the parser does not work as it should. I will fix this soon.
There are some other issues too, for example the menu does not loop as it should on erroneous input and 
there is no exit choice in the menu. These issues will also be fixed soon.
